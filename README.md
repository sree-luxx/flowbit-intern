## 🌟 Overview  

**Flowbit AI** is an end-to-end **Invoice Analytics Platform** designed to simplify how businesses manage and interpret invoice data.  
Instead of manually filtering spreadsheets or generating static reports, Flowbit empowers users to:  
- Seamlessly upload invoices  
- View structured analytics dashboards  
- Interact with their financial data using **natural language queries**

The video walkthrough demonstrates the full workflow — from loading data to generating AI-driven insights in real time.

## 🧠 Core Concept  

Traditional analytics tools often make users adapt to complex query languages.  
**Flowbit AI** flips that by letting the system understand *you*.  
Using **AI-powered querying**, users can ask things like:  
> “Show me all unpaid invoices from last quarter”  
> “What’s the total revenue from vendor X this month?”  

And Flowbit delivers accurate, formatted responses — all backed by dynamic database querying and modern visualizations.
